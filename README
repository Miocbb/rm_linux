Brief:
This is a script used to remove files on linux system
to a recycle bin, the similar functionality of recycle
bin in Windows system.


Install:
1. git clone this project into a place you like, and navigate
   to the root of this project.
2. make "rm_limux/run.py" executable by run "chmod +x run.py"
3. create an alias for the execute path of "./run.py".


Description:
1. A recycle bin named ".rycycle_bin" will be created under your home path.

2. The time when you deleted your each file will be recorded.
   According to the recorded time, all the deleted files will be categoried
   into deffirent folders under "~/.rycycle_bin". The name of folders in
   "~/.recycle_bin" is named by the year and the month according to recorded time.

3. Files thrown into the recycle_bin will be stamped by an prefix
   created by the recorded time, that is "day_hour_minute_second_microsecond:".

4. A log file, ".log", will be created in each folder under "~/.recycle_bin" to
   record the deleting details information. Log file will be updated everytime when
   files are moved in.


Usage:
'rm' alias is suggested for this script, so that original 'rm' of linux can be
overwrited.

Command illustration
1. Absolute and relative path of files or dirs are supported. "*" expression is also
   supported for specifying a class of files which match with certain pattern.
2. The usage of optional arguments is the same as linux 'rm' command. The position
   of optional arguments can be any position after 'rm' command. Combination
   optional arguments are supported. To pemanently delete files, use '-f' flag.
   To recursively delete directories, use '-r' flag.
   -->Example:
   $: rm [-f, -fr, -rf] Files Dirs # pemanently delete dirs and/or files.

   If '-f' not specified, the files will be moved to ~/.recycle_bin, instead of deleted.
   -->Example:
   $: rm [-r] Files Dirs    # temporary remove files or dirs into ~/.recycle_bin.

3. To clean and delete files or dirs existed inside ~/.recycle_bin, you can either specify
   '-f' flag or not to achieve cleanning.
   $: rm -f ~/.recycle_bin/files
   $: rm -f -r ~/.recycle_bin/dirs
   or just
   $: rm  ~/.recycle_bin/files
   $: rm  -r ~/.recycle_bin/dirs

   The ~/.recycle_bin/Date_Folder/.log file will be updated after your cleaning.
